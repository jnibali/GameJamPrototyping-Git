Prototype of Enemy AI checking for locked and unlocked doors

This demo has a AI check three doors to see if they are locked or unlocked
The player can lock and unlock the doors by walking up to one and pressing "R"

The player starts on a floating block so they can observe the enemy AI movement

Issue right now is the navlink for the doors is not working correctly. So the AI has a hardtime actually walking through the unlocked doors
